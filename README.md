# Board Game Collection Manager ðŸŽ²ðŸŽ²

A simple web app to help my family organize our massive board game collection (400+ games and counting!). We often spend way too much time staring at our wall of games trying to pick something that works for everyone - this app helps solve that problem.

## What it does
You can filter games based on:
- How many people want to play
- What style of game you're in the mood for
- How long you want to play

Each game shows up as a card with easy-to-read tags. Click on any card to see the full game description and details. There's even a random game picker when you can't decide!

## Adding games is super easy
Just type the name of the game and pick from the autocomplete list (which includes the year to make sure you're picking the right version). The app pulls all the game info automatically from BoardGameGeek.
